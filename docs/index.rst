Python utilities for estimating and transforming rigid body motion.


Hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/phausamann/rigid-body-motion


Overview
--------

This package provides a high-level interface for transforming arrays
describing motion of rigid bodies between different coordinate systems and
reference frames. The core of the reference frame handling is a fast
re-implementation of ROS's ``tf2`` library using ``numpy`` and
``numpy-quaternion``. The package also provides first-class support for
xarray_ data types.
